# Changelog

## 0.1.1

Everything here was found by writing [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md)
and running each documented command instead of assuming it worked.

### Fixed

- **The package could not be installed at all.** A `force-include` of
  `src/dropoutt/data` duplicated files that `packages` already carried, and
  hatchling refused to build: *"A second file is being added to the wheel
  archive at the same path"*. Removed; the wheel ships 4.4 MB of data as
  intended.
- **`--offline` reached the network.** `scan()` took no `offline` argument, so
  atlas coverage tried to download a ~500 MB embedding model on a node with no
  egress. `offline` is now threaded to the embedder, and a test fails on any
  socket connection during an offline scan.
- **`--offline` refused to use an already-populated cache.** The tokenizer and
  the chat template both returned empty rather than reading the cache, which
  silently changed every token number and disabled the loss-mask checks. Both
  now resolve locally, and an offline scan produces findings byte-identical to
  an online one.
- **`dropoutt fetch` did not exist**, although skipped-check messages told users
  to run it. Implemented: pre-downloads tokenizers, each model's
  `tokenizer_config.json`, and the atlas embedder into `DROPOUTT_CACHE`.
- **The fingerprint reported bytes on disk as `total_chars`, and `total_words`
  was hardcoded to 0.** Byte counts include JSON syntax and vary with language
  under UTF-8, so the one artifact meant to be comparable across datasets varied
  with file format. On the test fixture this reported 91,976 characters where
  there were 54,577.
- **`index-eval` wrote into the install tree**, failing on read-only
  site-packages, and building a private index silently switched off all ten
  bundled benchmarks. Indices are now written to the cache, and both locations
  are always searched.
- **Install hints lost their extras name.** rich parsed `[tokenizer]` as a style
  tag and deleted it, so users were told to `pip install 'dropoutt'`. All
  data-derived and hint strings are escaped at the render site; a dataset named
  `[red]` can no longer restyle the output either.
- `--quiet` help text described behaviour it does not have.

### Added

- `python -m dropoutt`, for the common case where the venv's `bin/` is not on
  `PATH`.
- [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md).
- Honest documentation of what the atlas region labels are, why they read as
  random words, and what the level-0 accuracy figure does not mean. See
  [docs/atlas.md](docs/atlas.md).

## 0.1.0

First release. Tier 0 and Tier 1 checks, a fingerprint, and a first atlas.

### Added

- **27 checks** across two tiers. Tier 0 is structural and needs no model; Tier 1
  is statistical. `dropoutt checks` lists them; `dropoutt checks <id>` explains
  one.
- **Zero-configuration scan.** Discovery, schema induction against ten known
  layouts, detection of files that are not training data at all, hypothesis-based
  profile inference, and a cross-tokenizer token budget when no `--model` is given.
- **Contamination scanning** using the Tülu 3 rule, against 10 bundled hashed
  8-gram indices for permissively licensed benchmarks. `dropoutt index-eval`
  builds an index from your own held-out set locally.
- **`atlas-lite-v0`**: 258 regions over 152,622 reference records, level-0
  taxonomy accuracy 0.864, region purity 0.785. Coverage is suppressed when the
  off-atlas rate exceeds 10%, and is reported per language.
- **Self-contained HTML report**, one file, no server and no CDN.
- **Three-valued exit codes**: 0 completed, 1 internal error, 2 usage, 10
  blocking findings under a declared target.
- Verified static registries: 22 benchmarks with their genuinely scorable eval
  splits, 12 chat-template families with literal delimiters, 37 models including
  the Turkish set, PII patterns with checksums.

### Policies enforced in code and covered by tests

- Nothing blocks a run whose purpose was never declared.
- No check recommends deleting data without a measured effect; every finding in
  this release is `unverified`.
- Cross-dataset overlap is directional.
- PII never reaches the report; a test fails if a planted secret appears.
- Anything that degraded says so.

### Known issues

See [docs/limitations.md](docs/limitations.md). The largest are that language
identification is the main source of false positives, scale above roughly a
million records is unprofiled, and the scan is single-process.
